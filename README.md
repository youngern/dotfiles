Dotfiles after onboarding from scratch

Instructions:

```bash
make
make restart
```

You'll need most packages / installation for this repo to get through onboarding.
However, some are by preference, so feel free to go through the directories and change anything.

A suggested flow would be:
- fork this repo
- clone to `$HOME/.dotfiles`
- commit any changes to VCS
- if you make any changes that may be beneficial to the rest of the team, make a PR.
